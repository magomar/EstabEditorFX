{"name":"Estabeditorfx","tagline":"Alternative Estab Editor for PC game Command Ops Battles from the Bulgue","body":"### EstabEditorFX\r\n\r\nThis project aims at providing an alternative Estab editor for the **Command Ops Battles from the Bulge** game series (CO:BFTB), from Panther Games. This editor is cross-platform desktop application implemented in Java and JavaFX.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis of this editor, compared with the original editor, is on the reuse and adaptation of existing data. The main features of the new editor are:\r\n- Supports working with two estab files simultaneously: one estab that is opened in read-only mode (referred to as the source estab); and a second estab that is opened for edition (this is referred to as the **target** estab).\r\n- Elements in the source estab can be individually copied into the target estab (the original editor supports importing an entire estab, but not single elements)\r\n- Supports standar CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), but only in the target estab. \r\n- Three methods to add elements to a estab:\r\n   - Clone elements from source estab into target estab.  The new element keeps the same id as the cloned element.\r\n   - Copy element from target estab into a new element in the source estab. The new element gets a new id.\r\n   - Create new element from scratch.\r\n- Supports _chained copy_: if an element refers to other elements, the copy/clone operation offers the option to copy all the related elements recursively \r\n- Copy operations detect and avoid duplicates\r\n- Forces can be created from scratch, specifying all its parameters and equipment, but also **by composition**. When a force is specified as composed of other forces, some of its attributes (like personnel and staff capacity) are derived from the constituent forces, and the same happens with its equipment.\r\n- Provides tool to check element references and fix errors automatically. \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nExecutable binaries are released as zip and tar files in the [release section](https://github.com/magomar/EstabEditorFX/releases) of the project.\r\nThe EstabEditorFX application can be run by simply uncompressing a binary release, entering into the bin folder and running the appropriate script, depending on the platform (_.sh_ for windows / _.bat_ for windows).\r\n\r\nThe sources can be downloaded directly from the links found at the top of this page or from the [project page](https://github.com/magomar/EstabEditorFX).\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n\r\nThis application has been created by @magomar and @heinetron\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nHaving trouble with the Editor?
