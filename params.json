{"name":"EstabEditorFX","tagline":"Alternative Estab Editor for PC game Command Ops Battles from the Bulgue","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThis project aims at providing an **alternative estab editor** for the **Command Ops Battles from the Bulge** game series (CO:BFTB), from [Panther Games](http://www.panthergames.com/). This editor is a cross-platform desktop application implemented in Java and JavaFX.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis of this editor (compared with the original editor) is on the reuse and adaptation of existing data, which is achieved by **accessing two estabs simultaneously**. The main features of the new editor are:\r\n- Supports working with **two estab files simultaneously**: one estab that is opened in read-only mode (referred to as the **source** estab); and a second estab that is opened for edition (referred to as the **target** estab).\r\n- Elements in the source estab can be individually copied into the target estab.\r\n- Copy operations recursively find elements referred inside the copied element and bring the user the option to also copy those elements (all of them or just a selection). For example, if we copy a vehicle equipped with a gun, it will bring the option to copy not just the vehicle but also the gun it is equipped with, as well as the ammunition required by that gun.\r\n- Copy operations detect and avoid duplicates.\r\n- Supports standar CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), but only in the target estab. \r\n- Three methods to add elements to a estab:\r\n- Clone elements from source estab into target estab.  The new element keeps the same id as the cloned element.\r\n- Copy element from target estab into a new element in the source estab. The new element gets a new id.\r\n- Create new element from scratch.\r\n- Forces can be created from scratch, specifying all its parameters and equipment, but also **by composition**. When a force is specified as composed of other forces, some of its attributes (like personnel and staff capacity) are derived from the constituent forces, and the same happens with its equipment.\r\n\r\nAdditional Tools:\r\n- Check references: this tool cheks for the correctness of element references and is able to fix some errors automatically (for example when the name doesn't match the id, but the id already exists). \r\n- List elements: this tool generates a list with all the elements, including their id, name and type of element (ammo, weapon, vehicle). Furthermore, it allows sorting the elements according to any of the three attributes listed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following image shows a screenshot of the editor with two estabs opened and some elements selected.\r\n![Example of the editor working with two estab files](http://www.4shared.com/download/igCxIsAtba/Captura2.JPG?lgfp=3000)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nExecutable binaries are released as zip and tar files in the [release section](https://github.com/magomar/EstabEditorFX/releases) of the project.\r\nThe EstabEditorFX application can be run by simply uncompressing a binary release, entering into the bin folder and running the appropriate script, depending on the platform (_.sh_ for windows / _.bat_ for windows).\r\n\r\nThe sources can be downloaded directly from the links found at the top of this page or from the [project page](https://github.com/magomar/EstabEditorFX).\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n\r\nThis application has been created by @magomar and @heinetron\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nHaving trouble with the Editor?
