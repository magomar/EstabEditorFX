{"name":"EstabEditorFX","tagline":"Alternative Estab Editor for PC game Command Ops Battles from the Bulgue","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nThis project aims at providing an alternative Estab editor for the **Command Ops Battles from the Bulge** game series (CO:BFTB), from [Panther Games](http://www.panthergames.com/). This editor is cross-platform desktop application implemented in Java and JavaFX.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis of this editor (compared with the original editor) is on the reuse and adaptation of existing data, which is achieved by **accessing two estabs simultaneously**. The main features of the new editor are:\r\n- Supports working with **two estab files simultaneously**: one estab that is opened in read-only mode (referred to as the **source** estab); and a second estab that is opened for edition (referred to as the **target** estab).\r\n- Elements in the source estab can be individually copied into the target estab.\r\n   - Copy operations recursively detectes referred elements and brings the user the option to also copy referred elements (all or just a selection of elements). For example, if we copy a vehicle equipped with machineguns, it will offer the option to copy not just the vehicle but also the machineguns it is equipped with.\r\n   - Copy operations detect and avoid duplicates.\r\n- Supports standar CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), but only in the target estab. \r\n- Three methods to add elements to a estab:\r\n   - Clone elements from source estab into target estab.  The new element keeps the same id as the cloned element.\r\n   - Copy element from target estab into a new element in the source estab. The new element gets a new id.\r\n   - Create new element from scratch.\r\n- Forces can be created from scratch, specifying all its parameters and equipment, but also **by composition**. When a force is specified as composed of other forces, some of its attributes (like personnel and staff capacity) are derived from the constituent forces, and the same happens with its equipment.\r\n- Able to check for the correctness of element references and fix some errors automatically. \r\n\r\nThe following image shows a screenshot of the editor with two estabs opened and some elements selected.\r\n![Example of the editor working with two estab files](http://www.4shared.com/download/igCxIsAtba/Captura2.JPG?lgfp=3000)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nExecutable binaries are released as zip and tar files in the [release section](https://github.com/magomar/EstabEditorFX/releases) of the project.\r\nThe EstabEditorFX application can be run by simply uncompressing a binary release, entering into the bin folder and running the appropriate script, depending on the platform (_.sh_ for windows / _.bat_ for windows).\r\n\r\nThe sources can be downloaded directly from the links found at the top of this page or from the [project page](https://github.com/magomar/EstabEditorFX).\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n\r\nThis application has been created by @magomar and @heinetron\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nHaving trouble with the Editor?
